## About

I wrote the application for the purpose of learning how to use databases based on GraphQL.

<br/>
The app contains the last 10 rockets fired by SpaceX. The data includes:
- when the rocket was launched, <br/>
- what kind of rocket they used, <br/>
- what was the base of operation, <br/>
- what load was in the rocket, and what was a load mass. <br/>

## Libriaries and dependencies:

-[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as a query language for API, <br/>
-[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for the purpose of fetch data, <br/>
-[Material-Ui](https://material-ui.com/) for a nice look at a low cost. <br/>
